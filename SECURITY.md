# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, contact:

- Email: calvinsturm@gmail.com
- Subject: `[LocalAgent Security] <short title>`

Include:

- Affected version/commit
- Reproduction steps
- Impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

## Response Expectations

- Initial acknowledgement target: within 72 hours
- Triage + severity classification: as quickly as possible
- Patch timeline depends on severity and exploitability

## Scope

Security reports are most helpful when they relate to:

- Trust/approval bypass
- Tool execution gate bypass
- Policy enforcement bypass
- Sensitive data leakage from artifacts/events/logs
- Unsafe defaults regression
